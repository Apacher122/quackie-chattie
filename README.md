# What is this?
I made this app because a friend wanted an app that literally does one function: Quacks when you press a button.  
I decided to make it into a chat app. The server is currently on Heroku and I am working on more functionalities.  
It is my goal to make software solutions for people that never asked for them.

# TO-DO
1. Create an iOS version (in progress)
2. Set up a user database (currently working with PostgreSQL on Heroku)
3. Work on my project the involves using the Google Smart Home API to literally scream when you're wasting electricity.
