# What is this?
Obviously, it's an android app.
I made this app because a friend wanted an app that literally does one function: Quacks when you press a button. Why? Who knows.  
Anyways, I decided to make it into a chat app. You login via Google sign-in, create a username (for first timers), then join or create a new chatroom.  
  
It is my goal to make software solutions for people that never asked for them.

# The design
My friend said "make it quack" then insisted that it would only be appropriate that the mascot would be a toad. Don't ask, because I don't know either.
