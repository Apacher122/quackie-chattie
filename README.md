# What is this?
Obviously, it's an android app.
I made this app because a friend wanted an app that literally does one function: Quacks when you press a button. Why? Who knows.  
Anyways, I decided to make it into a chat app. You login via Google sign-in, create a username (for first timers), then join or create a new chatroom.  
  
It is my goal to make software solutions for people that never asked for them.

# The design
My friend said "make it quack" then insisted that it would only be appropriate that the mascot would be a toad. Don't ask, because I don't know either.

# Tools/Libraries
- Socket.IO (Client)
- Firebase
- Google Sign-In

# TO-DO
1. ~~Create an iOS version (in progress)~~
2. ~~Finilize database~~
3. Work on my project the involves using the Google Smart Home API to literally scream when you're wasting electricity.

# Plans
1. E2EE
- My plans are to currently implement WhatsApp's version of end-to-end encryption. Because this is just an app I made for fun, I don't anticipate that there will be a network bottleneck utilizing this form of E2EE. For more information, or just to fulfill curiousities, here is the link to WhatsApp's Encryption  Overview whitepaper:
